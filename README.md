Python Phishing Scanner
Overview
The Python Phishing Scanner is a tool designed to detect potential phishing URLs and protect users from malicious links. This lightweight, command-line-based application inspects URLs and identifies phishing attempts using various predefined indicators such as URL patterns, suspicious domain names, and commonly observed phishing strategies.

Features
URL Scanning: Detects phishing attempts by analyzing URLs and highlighting suspicious elements.
Simple Interface: A clean and easy-to-use command-line interface for scanning URLs.
Efficiency: Quick and lightweight, designed to work efficiently without complex dependencies.
Real-time Scanning: Instantly analyzes URLs and provides feedback on potential risks.
How It Works
The scanner takes a URL as input.
It checks the URL for known phishing indicators such as:
Long domain names
Misleading domains (e.g., replacing "i" with "l")
Use of special characters
Known phishing blacklists
The tool then categorizes the URL as either safe or potentially malicious.
Usage
To run the phishing scanner:
run app.py file
add the url you want to scan


Future Enhancements
Integrating machine learning models for more accurate phishing detection.
Expanding the scanner to detect additional security threats.
Adding a web-based UI for easier access and broader functionality.
